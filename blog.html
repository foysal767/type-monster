                Answer: 8 ways to get undefined <br>
                a. Variable thai is not initialized will give undefined. <br>
                b. Set a value directly to undefined. <br>
                c. Deleting an element inside an array. <br>
                d. Accessing array elements outside of the index range. <br>
                e. Function with no return. <br>
                f. Parameter that in not passed will be undefined. <br>
                g. If return has nothing on the right side will return undefined. <br>
                h. Property that does not exists on an object will give undefined.</div>

              <div class="accordion-body">Answer: <br>
                Local storage: <br>
                a. The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB. <br>
                b. As it is not session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or manually. <br>
                c. The client  can only read local storage. <br>
                
                Session storage: <br>
                a. The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB. <br>
                b. It is session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed. <br>
                c. The client can not read session storage.</div>

                Global scope: <br>
                The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable. <br>
                
                Block scope: <br>
                Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.</div>

                JS Event loop: <br>
                “How is JavaScript asynchronous and single-threaded ?” The short answer is that JavaScript language is single-threaded and the asynchronous behaviour is not part of the JavaScript language itself, rather they are built on top of the core JavaScript language in the browser (or the programming environment) and accessed through the browser APIs. <br>
                Stack: <br> 
                This represents the single thread provided for JavaScript code execution. Function calls form a stack of frames (more on this below) <br>
                Browser or Web API: <br> 
                Browser or Web APIs are built into your web browser, and are able to expose data from the browser and surrounding computer environment and do useful complex things with it. They are not part of the JavaScript language itself, rather they are built on top of the core JavaScript language, providing you with extra superpowers to use in your JavaScript code. For example, the Geolocation API provides some simple JavaScript constructs for retrieving location data so you can say, plot your location on a Google Map. In the background, the browser is actually using some complex lower-level code (e.g. C++) to communicate with the device’s GPS hardware (or whatever is available to determine position data), retrieve position data, and return it to the browser environment to use in your code. But again, this complexity is abstracted away from you by the API
